TheSurvivalGamesProxy
=====================
Welcome everyone to The Survival Games Bungeecord plugin! 

This will be of use to massive servers that can't support all their players on one CB instance. 

This will allow you to run one SG instance across a network of CB servers, with one central hub server. 

It will integrate into the SurvivalGames plugin as a config option "BungeecordMode: true" 

~~@AgentTroll can you set up CI please and thank you.~~
I can't seem to find a Mave repo for Bungeecord... well until I do, no CI
